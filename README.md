## Introduction
This is a very small and simple prototype made in Unity, attempting to replicate "Minecraft" and developed in the midst of my study in video game programming at College of Bois-de-Boulogne. This is my final project for the "Use of a video game engine 1" course (session 3 of 5).

## F.A.Q.

> What is the game engine used?
- Unity v2021.3.19f1

> What is the development period?
- From September 6th 2022 to September 23rd 2022 [17 days period]

> What is "Beyond Prophecy" (company name in the project setting and on various GUI menus)?
- This is simply the name of my organization on Unity Gaming Services, and does not represent any actual company whatsoever.

## Credits
